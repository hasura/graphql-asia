                    <p>All attendees at this event are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.</p>

                    <p>This event is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate for any event venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without a refund at the discretion of the event organizers.</p>

                    <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

                    <p>Attendees asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>


                    <p>If an attendee engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event.</p>

                    <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of event staff immediately. </p>

                    <p>Event staff will be happy to help attendees contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.</p>

                    <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at the event venue and related social events.</p>
